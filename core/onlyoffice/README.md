# OnlyOffice Document Server

Browser-based office document editor. Runs as a shared backend that other apps (Seafile, Nextcloud, any WOPI-capable client) call into for live editing of `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, and similar formats.

One OnlyOffice instance serves many consumers. Each consumer authenticates with the same JWT secret.

## Architecture

Single service:

| Service | Image | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `app` | `onlyoffice/documentserver:9.3.1.2` | Node.js server + rendering, serves the editor at `/web-apps/apps/api/documents/api.js` |

There is no DB container in this setup — the image bundles its own PostgreSQL + Redis + RabbitMQ for internal state. This is the upstream-recommended "single container" deployment.

### JWT handshake

Every editing request carries a signed JWT. Both sides — OnlyOffice and the consuming app — must hold the same secret:

```
┌────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
│ Seafile /  │─────▶│ Traefik      │─────▶│ OnlyOffice   │
│ Nextcloud  │ JWT  │ (TLS + CSP)  │ JWT  │ (verify)     │
└────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └──────────────┘
  JWT_SECRET         frame-ancestors        JWT_SECRET
  (shared)                                   (shared)
```

Mismatched secrets → documents open read-only with "Token is invalid" in the browser console.

### Why iframe embedding needs a custom Traefik chain

OnlyOffice has to be embedded in an `<iframe>` inside Seafile / Nextcloud. Every `sec-*` middleware chain in this repo sets `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, which browsers honour strictly and block the iframe.

The `docker-compose.yml` therefore defines two dedicated middlewares:

- `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}-proto` — sets `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` and `X-Forwarded-Host` so OnlyOffice generates HTTPS URLs (otherwise Mixed Content errors in the editor)
- `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}-headers` — HSTS + nosniff + `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors <allowed-origins>` instead of a blanket frame-deny

The allowed origins come from `ONLYOFFICE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env`.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Create .env
cp .env.example .env
# Edit: APP_TRAEFIK_HOST, ONLYOFFICE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS, TZ

# 2. Generate the JWT secret
mkdir -p .secrets
openssl rand -base64 30 | tr -d '\n' > .secrets/jwt_secret.txt

# 3. Start
docker compose up -d

# 4. First boot takes ~90s (PostgreSQL init + document server warm-up)
docker compose logs app --follow

# 5. Verify
curl -fsSI https://<APP_TRAEFIK_HOST>/healthcheck   # 200 OK
```

### Connecting from a consuming app

For each app that will use OnlyOffice, copy the JWT secret into its own secrets directory:

```bash
cp .secrets/jwt_secret.txt ../../apps/seafile/.secrets/onlyoffice_jwt_secret.txt
cp .secrets/jwt_secret.txt ../../apps/nextcloud/.secrets/onlyoffice_jwt_secret.txt
```

Then configure that app to point at:

```
https://<APP_TRAEFIK_HOST>/web-apps/apps/api/documents/api.js
```

Exact configuration UI differs per app — see the consuming app's README.

## Verify

```bash
docker compose ps                          # healthy
curl -fsSI https://<APP_TRAEFIK_HOST>/healthcheck
curl -fsSI https://<APP_TRAEFIK_HOST>/web-apps/apps/api/documents/api.js
```

Open an office doc from a connected app and confirm the editor loads in an iframe without `X-Frame-Options` errors in the browser console.

## Security Model

- Only the JWT secret is Docker Secret; OnlyOffice reads it via the entrypoint wrapper (`config/entrypoint.sh`) because the upstream image doesn't support `_FILE` env vars.
- The custom `-headers` middleware keeps HSTS, nosniff, and `referrer-policy`-equivalent protections while permitting controlled iframe embedding.
- `ONLYOFFICE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is a CSP allowlist. Any domain not listed here is rejected by the browser, even if it holds a valid JWT.
- `no-new-privileges:true` on the container.

## Backup

| | |
|---|---|
| **Database** | None in this stack. |
| **State** | `.secrets/jwt_secret.txt` — shared with the embedding application |
| **Reproducible** | `./volumes/data` (document cache) · `./volumes/logs` |
| **Quiescing** | Not applicable. |

Documents live in the application that embeds this document server and are backed
up there. What is cached here is a working copy.

The JWT secret is the only thing whose loss is felt: both sides have to hold the
same value, so regenerating it means updating the embedding application too.
Editing stays broken until they match, and the error surfaces there rather than
here.

## Known Issues

- **Image size is large (~1.5 GB)** — this is upstream; the document server bundles LibreOffice, Node.js, Nginx, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Redis. No slim variant is available.
- **Log volume grows quickly.** `./volumes/logs` is mounted so logs persist; rotate or truncate it periodically if disk usage matters.
- **`APP_TRAEFIK_SECURITY` is not used.** Setting it in `.env` has no effect — the compose file wires the custom middleware chain unconditionally. Left in the `.env.example` with a comment so nobody is surprised.
- **JWT secret rotation is not automatic.** Rotating means updating the secret file in OnlyOffice _and_ every consuming app, then restarting each.
- **`ONLYOFFICE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` changes require container recreation.** The value is embedded in a Traefik label at container startup time — `docker compose restart` does not update it. Run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate` to apply a new or updated allowed origin.
